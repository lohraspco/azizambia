   app configuration into a `.env.local` file:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=... 
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=...
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=...
  NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=...
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=...
   ```

3. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open the app**
   Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to explore the cinematic onboarding, discovery, and messaging
   experiences.

## üß™ Recommended Firebase Security Rules (excerpt)
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /profiles/{userId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null &&
        (resource.data.isVisibleInDiscovery == true || request.auth.uid == userId);
      allow write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
    }

    match /conversations/{conversationId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid in resource.data.participants;
